# Mesh Viewer

**Mesh Viewer** is a lightweight C++ OpenGL project that lets you load and display 3D models (starting with `.obj` files).  

Right now, it handles basic geometry, but the plan is to grow it into a small but capable tool with textures, PBR, and maybe even mesh editing features.

## Plans

This project is still early, but goal:

- Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)
- Basic lighting and material support
- Environment maps / HDR skybox lighting
- Mesh transformations (move, scale, rotate)
- A user interface using ImGui for toggles and loading new models
